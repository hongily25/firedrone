# Getting started with the FireDrone.AI Open Hack
Get started with the hackathon in a few simple steps.

1. Access the Azure Notebook starter project:

  https://notebooks.azure.com/Solliance/projects/firedrone-ai

2. Clone the Project into your own account.

3. Open the `Starter.ipynb` notebook and step thru it, following the instructions.

If you prefer an offline, python focused version of the starter instructions, feel free to view the [PDF version](./starter.pdf). You can also download a copy of the Jupyter Notebook without going thru the Azure Notebooks project [from here](./Starter.ipynb) though you will need to clone this repository to get to it.
